## Grafana
* add prometheus data source (Administratiom/Data Sources --> Add new data source, select Prometheus, add ``http://localhost:9090`` as url)
* enable smtp and set mailhost (via enviromental variables)


### Alerting

* add contact point (mailhog)
* create alert rule 
    * ``node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / (1024*1024*1024) < 5``
    * add label ``severity=warning``
* create notification policies
    * new nested policy and select label ``severity=warning``
    
## Mailhog
[Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) is an email testing tool that makes it super easy to install and configure a local email server. MailHog sets up a fake SMTP server. You can configure your preferred web applications to use MailHogâ€™s SMTP server to send and receive emails.

## Prometheus
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit.

## Prometheus Node Exporter

The [Prometheus Node Exporter](https://www.opsramp.com/guides/prometheus-monitoring/prometheus-node-exporter/)  is an open-source time-series monitoring and alerting system for cloud-native environments, including Kubernetes, hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) on GitHub. It can collect and store node-level metrics as time-series data, recording information with a timestamp. It can also collect and record labels, which are optional key-value pairs.
